                    A merit-based scholarship is a type of financial aid awarded to students based on their academic achievements, talents, skills, or other non-financial criteria. Unlike need-based scholarships, which are awarded to students based on financial need, merit-based scholarships are awarded to recognize and reward students for their exceptional academic performance, leadership qualities, extracurricular involvement, community service, or other outstanding accomplishments.
